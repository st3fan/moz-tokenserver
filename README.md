moz-tokenserver
===============

This project implements a very minimal [Token Server](https://docs.services.mozilla.com/token/index.html) to be used in combination with the [moz-storageserver](https://github.com/st3fan/moz-storageserver) project.

Running both of these services allows you to host your own Firefox Sync storage solution.

> Note: this is work in progress and has not reached a stable version yet.

Requirements
------------

This project requires Go 1.3.1 and some external dependencies that are available on Github.
